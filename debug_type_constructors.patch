Let me create a minimal test to check if the type constructor is being stored correctly.

The issue might be that the return type parsing isn't working as expected for zero-argument constructors.

For the constructor definition:
```
Cons : (x : number) => Simple
```

The return type should be parsed as either:
1. `TVar (TypeVar "Simple")` - if parsed as a simple type variable
2. `TApplication "Simple" []` - if parsed as a type application with no arguments

Let me check which one it is by examining the existing examples that work.
